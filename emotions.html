<h2 class="sansserif">Guinea Pig Emotions</h2>
    <p class="sansserif">Just like humans, guinea pigs have a wide range of emotions. The one they most use is probably disappointment. I mean, they have high standards and to them humans are just incompetent creatures that keep them in cages. If I were them I would be disappointed too.</p>
