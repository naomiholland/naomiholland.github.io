    <h2 class="sansserif">Guinea Pig Emotions</h2>
<p class="sansserif">Just like humans, guinea pigs have a wide range of emotions. The one they most use is probably disappointment. I mean, they have high standards and to them humans are just incompetent creatures that keep them in cages. If I were them I would be disappointed too.</p>

    <h2>How to Converse With Your Guinea Pig</h2>
    <p class="sansserif">Today, guiea pigs can speak over 50 human languages, including English, Mandarin, Japanese, and French, although most of them only speak Spanish or Portuguese. I must add that while they do speak all of those languages, most don't talk to humans unless they need to or if they trust you. My guinea pig trusts me very much so we talk a lot, but he only knows Spanish.</p>
