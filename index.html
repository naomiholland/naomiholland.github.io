<h2>A Brief History</h2>
    <p>Guinea pigs were first domesticated in South America around 2000bc. Originally they were kept for food but later they started being cared for as pets. They first started speaking in human languages in 260bc. Naturally, as they lived in South America, they started with Portuguese and Spanish.

    <p>Brief history over</p>

<p>Today, guiea pigs can speak over 50 human languages, including English, Mandarin, Japanese, and French, although most of them only speak Spanish or Portuguese</p>

<h2>Guinea Pig Emotions</h2>
<p>Just like humans, guinea pigs have a wide range of emotions. The one they most use is probably disappointment. I mean, they have high standards and to them humans are just incompetent creatures that keep them in cages. If I were them I would be disappointed too.
