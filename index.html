  <p class="sansserif">I became interested in guinea pigs at a young age. They are such fascinating creatures, are they not? So complex and deep. When you stare into their eyes it's like you can see into their souls.</p>
      <p class="sansserif">That is why I made this website, so that others can see guinea pigs for who they really are and love them as much as I do.</p>
      <p class="sansserif">Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed.</p>
